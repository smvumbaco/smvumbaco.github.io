									<h1>Generate: AutoPasser</h1>
									<p>AutoPasser is an automatic hockey puck shooter. It is designed to fire street hockey pucks at a user-specified speed at regular 
										intervals. This prototype saw two major development cycles. The first cycle was mainly a proof-of-concept that sought to ensure
										the firing and automatic loading subsystems were viable. The second cycle sought to massively overhaul this original design, 
										adding rotation, remote control, and puck sensing features while decreasing both the footprint and weight of the device. For 
										both project phases, I was chiefly responsible for all electrical subsystems. This included motor control, linear actuator extension
										and retraction, turret roation, power management, voltage regulation, circuit protection, circuit assembly, and software development, 
										among other responsibilities.

								<p>The first prototype is showcased in the video linked above. Pucks were loaded into parallel spinning tracks by a linear actuator, 
									and Vex Robotics CIM motors were used to power the firing system itself. The UI and general system logic was governed by an Arduino
									MEGA. The entire system was powered by a 120VAC to 12VDC AC/DC converter. While primitive, the success of this prototype warranted 
									a second revision that greatly expanded on the design and capabilities of the original design.

								<p>The second iteration of the AutoPasser prototype is shown above. This design largely achieved its outlined goals of being smaller, 
									lighter, and having increased capabilities. The CIM motors were swapped out with the more-efficient NEO motors, and the linear actuator
									was replaced with a much smaller model. Using an ultrasonic sensor, dynamic puck detection was implemented to ensure the system 
									always knew when it was out of pucks. Using ESP-32 microcontrollers, remote firing was added using Bluetooth to communicate between
									a remote control and the main console. Individual and unique PCBAs were developed for this purpose and are shown below. Finally, the 
									entire chassis was placed on a gear system controlled by a stepper motor, which allowed for pucks to be fired at different angles. 
									The UI was also updated with a touch-screen and a simplified control scheme; all of which was maintained by a dedicated microcontroller
									that communicated with the console-side ESP-32 via UART. The updated AutoPasser protoype also included an enhanced cable and wire 
									management, a feature that was largely absent from the first design.

								<p>Both iterations of AutoPasser were excellent exercises in good practices and safety procedures. Given that the firing system motors used
									in these designs were extremely current-hungry, the addition of master-OFF switches and circuit breakers was mandatory for the safety 
									of both the engineers and users.
