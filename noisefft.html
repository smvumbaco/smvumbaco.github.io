									<h1>Emerald Innovations: Fan Noise FFT Characterization</h1>
									<p>One big problem with the health monitoring device that persisted for nearly my entire tenure at 
										Emerald was audible noise generated by the fan meant to cool the electronics. Because the device
										is meant to be mounted very close to a participant as they sleep, nearly any noise would be far 
										too loud for comfort. However, this noise was difficult to characterize, as precise volume 
										measurements are nearly infeasible without expensive equipment in very controlled environments.
									</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/noise_awake.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>However, the team discerned that the noise wasn't necessarily from the fan blides rotating through 
										the air, but rather the vibration of the fan against the case as it moved. With this knowledge, I 
										was able to characterize this noise through the use of an accelerometer. I fastened an IMU at a 
										spot that would experience the most vibration, measured the resulting accelerometer vectors while 
										the fan was running, and ran an FFT to discern at what frequency the fan vibrated at. This yielded 
										promising results; with the ability to know the frequency and intensity  of the fan vibrations, 
										modifying the speed at which the fan spun became much more productive, as noise data was clearly 
										quantifiable. 
									</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/fft_graphic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>The most challenging aspect of this task was not the software (calculating an FFT on a set of data), 
										but rather the firmware. I employed basic sampling theory to discern that my sampling rate, or the 
										rate at which the accelerometer collected measurement data, had to be at least twice the frequency 
										of the fan vibrations. Knowing the clock speed used by the accelerometer, basic I2C read/write 
										commands proved much too slow to achieve the appropriate sampling rate. Therefore, I used a data 
										batching method that employed buffers and temporary storage to maximize the speed at which the 
										accelerometer measured data to achieve the most accurate results.
